<P>Who We Are
Welcome to AISSMSCOE Computer Dept. Library Portal. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal data. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of personal data we collect and how we use it.

Comments
When you leave a comment on our website, we collect the information you provide in the comments form. This includes your name, email address, and any content you submit. Additionally, we automatically collect your IP address and browser user agent string to prevent spam.

Please note that your email address is anonymized (hashed) and may be shared with the Gravatar service to determine if you have a profile picture associated with it. 

Media
If you choose to upload images to our website, please ensure that they do not contain embedded location data (EXIF GPS). Visitors to the website can download and extract location data from such images.

Contact Forms
When you use our contact forms, we collect the information you provide, including your name, email address, and any messages you send. This data is used solely for communication purposes and is not shared with third parties.

Cookies
If you leave a comment on our site, you may opt-in to store your name, email address, and website in cookies. These cookies are designed for your convenience, so you don't have to fill in your details every time you leave a new comment. The cookies will remain valid for one year.

Additionally, when you visit our login page, a temporary cookie is set to check if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and will be discarded once you close your browser.

For registered users, we set cookies to store login information and screen display preferences. Login cookies are valid for two days, while screen options cookies last for a year. If you choose the "Remember Me" option, your login will persist for two weeks. Logging out of your account will remove the login cookies.

Embedded Content from Other Websites
Our articles may include embedded content (e.g., videos, images, articles) from other websites. Embedded content behaves in the same way as if you visited the original website.

These third-party websites may collect data about you, use cookies, and track your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to their website.

Analytics
We use analytics tools to gather information about website traffic and user behavior. This data is used to improve our website's performance and user experience.

Data Sharing
We do not share your personal data with any third parties, except as required by law or when necessary to provide services to you. Your privacy is important to us, and we take measures to protect your data.

Data Retention
If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata will be retained indefinitely. This allows us to recognize and approve follow-up comments automatically, rather than holding them for moderation.

For registered users, we store the personal information provided in their user profile. Users can view, edit, or delete their personal data at any time (except for the username, which cannot be changed). Website administrators also have access to this information for administrative purposes.

Your Rights
If you have an account on our site or have left comments, you can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. You can also request the deletion of your personal data, excluding any data we are required to retain for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or your personal data, please feel free to contact us. We value your privacy and are committed to addressing any inquiries promptly and responsibly.

(Note: This revised Privacy Policy is a paraphrased version and has been modified to avoid copyright issues.)</P>
